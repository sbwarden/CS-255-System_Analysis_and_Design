# CS-255 Reflection


## DriverPass Project Summary
For this course we dealt with a client, DriverPass. They wanted to create an onine platform to fill the void in teaching students how to pass the drivers test. They wanted a cloud-based web server to offer online practice quizes as well as driving classes with specific instructors. There were three packages of varying levels offered, each with a different number of driving lessons and access to classes and quizes.

## What did I do well?
I belive that I understood what the client was looking for and able to flesh out their idea a bit. This lead to an exemplary business requirements document that went in depth explaing what was needed, what was wanted, and what the limitations were. 

## What could I revise and improve upon?
I would like to improve upon my activity diagrams. I think that there could have been more explanation shown on how the systems work and what the loops were for certain areas of the system. 

## Interpreting user's needs
The user's needs are arguably the most important part of the system design. Yes, you want the client to get all of the aspects they want included in the design, but it all means nothing if the user cannot interact with the final product. The user's needs were relatively straight forward for this project as most of us have used an online learning platform and booking service before. This was essentially combining the two methods into one site. Know what processes have worked and not worked for us in the past with outside sites, helped me know what the user would need, especially in a not ideal senario, say forgetting your password. 

## How do I approach designing software?
When designing software I think that it is extremely imporant to get as much facetime with the client as possible so you can understand what they want and why they want it. We all have a tendency to speak differently in person versus over the phone or email, so seeing a person's face is important. I also like the use of the different kinds of UML diagrams. Being able to plan, as much as is possible in the agile world, will making coding and implementing the final product much easier.
